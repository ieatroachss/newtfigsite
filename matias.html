  <b>
I miss the old Matias, straight from the Go Matias<br>
Chop up the soul Matias, set on his goals Matias<br>
I hate the new Matias, the bad mood Matias<br>
The always rude Matias, spaz in the news Matias<br>
I miss the sweet Matias, chop up the beats Matias<br>
I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Matias<br>
See, I invented Matias, it wasn't any Matiases<br>
And now I look and look around and there's so many Matiases<br>
I used to love Matias, I used to love Matias<br>
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Matias<br>
What if Matias made a song about Matias<br>
Called "I Miss the Old Matias"? Man, that'd be so Matias<br>
That's all it was, Matias, we still love Matias<br>
And I love you like Matias loves Matias<br>
