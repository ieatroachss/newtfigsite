  <meta property="og:description" content="I miss the old Matias, straight from the Go Matias
Chop up the soul Matias, set on his goals Matias
I hate the new Matias, the bad mood Matias
The always rude Matias, spaz in the news Matias
I miss the sweet Matias, chop up the beats Matias
I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Matias
See, I invented Matias, it wasn't any Matiases
And now I look and look around and there's so many Matiases
I used to love Matias, I used to love Matias
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Matias
What if Matias made a song about Matias
Called I Miss the Old Matias? Man, that'd be so Matias
That's all it was, Matias, we still love Matias
And I love you like Matias loves Matias">
